7-zip&amp;rsquo;s -u switch provides fine-grained control over creating and updating archives based on states of archived and to-be-archived files. The switch is specified as a combination of state-action flags (more info):
State State condition File on Disk File in Archive p File exists in archive, but is not matched with wildcard ?</description></item><item><title>Simple recovery of LUKS-encrypted partitions</title><link>https://nagimov.me/post/simple-recovery-of-luks-encrypted-partitions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 16:32:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nagimov.me/post/simple-recovery-of-luks-encrypted-partitions/</guid><description>There are scary number of ways to end up with a screwed up drive encrypted via LUKS:

10 VALVE1_POS = S405_VH(1400)
20 VALVE2_POS = 80.0
30 IF VALVE1_POS &amp;gt; 50.0 THEN VALVE3_POS = 99.5 ELSE VALVE3_POS = 0.5
&amp;hellip;and let me follow your observations:
you notice a weird line enumeration, just like in good old BASIC, you see three variables, VALVE1_POS, VALVE2_POS and VALVE3_POS, you find S405_VH(1400) most likely to be a function call retrieving a position of the valve 1, position of the valve 2 is set to 80.</description></item><item><title>Running docker on 32-bit hosts</title><link>https://nagimov.me/post/running-docker-on-32-bit-hosts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 00:42:28 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nagimov.me/post/running-docker-on-32-bit-hosts/</guid><description>Docker is known to not to support 32-bit hosts. As per their debian installation instruction: Docker CE is supported on x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, and arm64 architectures. And that is plain wrong.
A tiny bit of extra support from docker-the-company would extend its use to older hardware, but (apparently) this is not a priority. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s bring docker on 32-bit&amp;rdquo; issue was closed and locked in 2014, and nothing has changed since then.</description></item><item><title>alsa-utils' arecord bug: lots of *.wav files, ignoring --duration parameter</title><link>https://nagimov.me/post/alsa-utils-arecord-bug-lots-of-.wav-files-ignoring-duration-parameter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2016 20:56:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nagimov.me/post/alsa-utils-arecord-bug-lots-of-.wav-files-ignoring-duration-parameter/</guid><description>While working on a little side project, I found that I can&amp;rsquo;t record sound using Raspberry Pi with external USB sound card after upgrading it to Raspbian Jessie. Symptoms look rather weird: arecord doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop recording after a period of time specified by --duration flag, but keeps running and writing garbage to files like *-01.wav, *-02.wav and so on. Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give any solution to this (except the recommendation of terminating arecord using killall -KILL arecord after certain period of time).</description></item><item><title>Calibrating MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier</title><link>https://nagimov.me/post/calibrating-max31855-thermocouple-amplifier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 17:55:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nagimov.me/post/calibrating-max31855-thermocouple-amplifier/</guid><description>I have recently spent some time playing with Maxim 31855 chips, in a need of a precise and cheap K-type thermocouple logger. It is a simple voltage amplifier with digital SPI interface, so it works perfectly well with Raspberry Pi or Arduino.
There are many thermocouple amplifiers out there, and I am sure that most of them are properly calibrated for temperatures around +/-50C, since even linear volt-to-degreeC conversion works fine in that range.</description></item><item><title>Amazon Fire TV 2nd Gen - Root &amp; OpenVPN</title><link>https://nagimov.me/post/amazon-fire-tv-2nd-gen-root-openvpn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 19:35:32 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nagimov.me/post/amazon-fire-tv-2nd-gen-root-openvpn/</guid><description>My notes after spending half a day playing with my Fire TV.
While Amazon Fire TV seems to be the best htpc solution for me, it still requires rooting and a bit of patching on its way to a decent media center. I&amp;rsquo;m also used to US streaming services (Pandora, Netflix, Hulu, etc.) that are only available through VPN, if you are outside of US. Rooting and setting up Kodi + OpenVPN is a way to go.</description></item></channel></rss>
