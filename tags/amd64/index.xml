As per their debian installation instruction: Docker CE is supported on x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, and arm64 architectures. And that is plain wrong.
A tiny bit of extra support from docker-the-company would extend its use to older hardware, but (apparently) this is not a priority. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s bring docker on 32-bit&amp;rdquo; issue was closed and locked in 2014, and nothing has changed since then.</description></item></channel></rss>
