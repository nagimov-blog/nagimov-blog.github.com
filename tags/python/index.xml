It is a cheap voltage amplifier with digital SPI interface, so it works perfectly well with Raspberry Pi or Arduino.
There are many thermocouple amplifiers out there, and I am sure that most of them are properly calibrated for the temperature range around +/-50C, since even linear volt-to-degreeC conversion works fine in that range.</description></item></channel></rss>
