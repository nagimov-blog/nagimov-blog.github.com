As per their debian installation instruction: Docker CE is supported on x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, and arm64 architectures. And that is plain wrong.
A tiny bit of extra support from docker-the-company would extend its use to older hardware, but (apparently) this is not a priority. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s bring docker on 32-bit&amp;rdquo; issue was closed and locked in 2014, and nothing has changed since then.</description></item><item><title>alsa-utils' arecord bug: lots of *.wav files, ignoring --duration parameter</title><link>https://nagimov.me/post/alsa-utils-arecord-bug-lots-of-.wav-files-ignoring-duration-parameter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2016 20:56:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nagimov.me/post/alsa-utils-arecord-bug-lots-of-.wav-files-ignoring-duration-parameter/</guid><description>While working on a little side project, I found that I can&amp;rsquo;t record sound using Raspberry Pi with external USB sound card after upgrading it to Raspbian Jessie. Symptoms look rather weird: arecord doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop recording after a period of time specified by --duration flag, but keeps running and writing garbage to files like *-01.wav, *-02.wav and so on. Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give any solution to this (except the recommendation of terminating arecord using killall -KILL arecord after certain period of time).</description></item></channel></rss>
